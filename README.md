# Triptide - Ride Sharing App

Triptide is a ride-sharing application built on the MERN stack, allowing customers to create ride requests and drivers to accept rides within a 5 km radius of their location. Users can rate each other after completing a ride, and drivers can update the status of rides.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely.
- **Create Ride Requests:** Customers can create ride requests specifying their destination.
- **Driver Acceptance:** Drivers within a 5 km radius can accept ride requests.
- **Real-time Updates:** Users receive real-time updates on the status of their rides.
- **Rating System:** Both customers and drivers can rate each other after completing a ride.
- **Ride Status Management:** Drivers can update the status of rides (e.g., accepted, in progress, completed).

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB:** For storing user data, ride requests, and ride details.
- **Express.js:** Handling server-side logic and routing.
- **React.js:** Building the user interface and components.
- **Node.js:** Running the server-side logic and connecting with the database.
- **Socket.io:** Providing real-time communication between clients and the server.
- **Mapbox API:** For location-based services and calculating distances.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** For secure authentication and authorization.
